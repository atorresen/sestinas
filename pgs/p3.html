  <p>
    They’re paying me to write sestinas.<br>
    Twelve dollars an hour<br>
    They’ve even provided this notebook<br>
    And this gel pen, dark and precise.<br>
    I figure it’s better to sit here scribbling<br>
    Than twiddling my thumbs, staring into space.<br>
    <br>
    It is nice to have a cubicle, a desk, some drawers, some shelf space.<br>
    I even have an adjustable swivel chair.<br>
    There’s a printing room, but also lots of paper at my desk that’s barely scribbled<br>
    I’ve been here so far today for six hours -<br>
    Five an a half, actually, to be precise -<br>
    And I’ve filled 18 pages of notebook.<br>
    <br>
    There is a pile of perfect notebooks<br>
    Right by my feet: one subject, college ruled, folder space.<br>
    No one was precise<br>
    About the office etiquette,<br>
    but I assume that if I work here 40 hours<br>
    each week, I’ve earned a couple tools for scribbling.<br>
    <br>
    Don’t worry - I only scribble<br>
    When I have no work, and so far I’ve only used two notebooks.<br>
    Each of my assignments takes an hour,<br>
    Sometimes two, which leaves enormous space<br>
    for boredom,<br>
    or poetry writing, to be precise.<br>
    <br>
    Passersby see me leaning over my work with focus and precision.<br>
    Good thing they can’t read my scribbles.<br>
    I’ve got my email open on my computer screen.<br>
    As long as I wear a button-up, use these professional notebooks,<br>
    and stay deep within my own cubicle space,<br>
    I can write poems for hours.<br>
    <br>
    And hours. And hours.<br>
    My rhyme scheme and enjambments aren’t precise,<br>
    My spacing<br>
    Is irregular, some words merely scribbles,<br>
    But I’m filling up notebooks<br>
    Like pitchers of Grandma’s sweet tea.<br>
    <br>
    Lined space fills up with scribbles.<br>
    An hour fills up in sixty minutes precisely.<br>
    My notebook fills up with rubber ducks.<br>
    <br>

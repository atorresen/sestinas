    Look (looque) at the fragile<br>
    Tongue sliding across<br>
    The mouth of father Q<br>
    Reminiscent of a logo of hope,<br>
    Shapely as a sea creature,<br>
    Imprinted in streaky green.<br>
    <br>
    Also in deep forest green<br>
    Is an i with a sturdy<br>
    tittle - a severed creature,<br>
    looking at his older brother across<br>
    a millimeter of hope,<br>
    A young i<br>
    <br>
    Longing to separate and grow to I.<br>
    Another member in the parade of green:<br>
    Capital P giving hope<br>
    To his trail of fragile<br>
    Younglings, courageously following father Q across<br>
    Their home shaped like a caterpillar.<br>
    <br>
    The singularly stemmed y-creature<br>
    May wonder why (y)<br>
    Your eyes move across<br>
    Past its solidly planted foot, dripping green<br>
    Disrupting the fragile<br>
    edge of the oblong hope-colored<br>
    <br>
    sticker. I hope<br>
    Addressing together the repetitive creatures<br>
    Will not seem inadequate:<br>
    two u’s, two m’s,<br>
    Double doses of green<br>
    Span across<br>
    <br>
    Family trees, Leaves spread across<br>
    Multiple younger generations, in a hopeful<br>
    Tribute to their ancestor, Green ink,<br>
    communicating through these creatures,<br>
    The poses and expressions of each letter,<br>
    Each fragile<br>
    <br>
    Child contributes a new sight, sound, symphony. These green creatures,<br>
    Lining up across their rectangle, apprehensive yet hopeful,<br>
    Show a premium quality message of strength in sticky delicateness.<br>

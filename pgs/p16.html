  <p>
    Today I pack up my things<br>
    And take what I want to keep<br>
    Because it’s my last day<br>
    In the office,<br>
    Unless they tell me that I have<br>
    To come in again<br>
    <br>
    Next week. Yet again<br>
    today, I have nothing<br>
    to do. I have<br>
    no emails important enough to keep.<br>
    I’m sitting in an empty office<br>
    on a summer Friday.<br>
    <br>
    But a day<br>
    is not wasted if again<br>
    I pull out my notebook and concoct an office-inspired<br>
    sestina. A poem and $12 an hour is not nothing!<br>
    And now I get to keep<br>
    A catalogue of the experiences I had.<br>
    <br>
    In this 8”x5” 80 page Narrow Rule spiral, I have<br>
    collected my work days.<br>
    I have captured and kept<br>
    Boredom, creativity, and again<br>
    Boredom. Proof that I gained something<br>
    From this downtown DC office.<br>
    <br>
    Offices<br>
    have<br>
    nothing<br>
    that summer days<br>
    don’t again<br>
    keep.<br>
    <br>
    Kept<br>
    offices<br>
    again<br>
    have<br>
    days<br>
    of nothing.<br>
    <br>
    Today again I have written<br>
    A keepsake inspired by the office,<br>
    Celebrating my last day full of nothing.<br>
    <br>

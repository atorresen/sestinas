  <p>
    stone gray start surface.<br>
    fingers guide a lump of coal<br>
    pulsing with a red germ.<br>
    work, work, work,<br>
    scroll until the screen achieves a steady boil,<br>
    until you hear a buzz,<br>
    <br>
    buzz, buzz,<br>
    static swarms the smutty surface.<br>
    sterilize by boiling,<br>
    erase by burning coal,<br>
    erase, erase, work -<br>
    don’t catch or spread the lazy germ!<br>
    <br>
    hand sanitizer: 99/100 germs<br>
    slip away from a steady buzz<br>
    of keyboards, printing, working.<br>
    7th floor: neither abyss nor surface,<br>
    far above the concrete and coal,<br>
    close enough to the sun to boil.<br>
    <br>
    upstairs the water cooler boils,<br>
    coffee machine brews gossip.<br>
    lunch break to meet Cole,<br>
    soon return to the buzz<br>
    of surface, printing, surface,<br>
    work, drink, work.<br>
    <br>
    Metro cuts off work,<br>
    second hands roar, armpits boil,<br>
    warm surfaces<br>
    so gritty and grimy that public service gossip<br>
    warns of germs more fatal than the buzz<br>
    of electric trains.<br>
    <br>
    heels marked with soot and coal,<br>
    cold air vanishes, hot breath working,<br>
    escalator’s ragged buzz<br>
    lifts us up toward home, to boil<br>
    water for rice, to hear my puppy’s gossip,<br>
    puddles of pee on every surface,<br>
    <br>
    break free to cicada buzz and the almost-boil<br>
    of green tea. I will see Cole tomorrow, when I don’t have to work.<br>
    Gossip, slip, gossip, superficial, taught me to dive and break the surface<br>
    <br>

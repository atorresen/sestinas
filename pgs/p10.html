  <p>
    Utopian ideal of unity<br>
    Delicious creamy blue<br>
    Ink, staining honest documents<br>
    Interrupted by a red<br>
    Correction; No pachydermic nuisance<br>
    Disturbs the Land of Moore.<br>
    <br>
    When a leader cites ‘No More!’<br>
    And, at the expense of democracy, champions unity<br>
    Her people will have avoided the nuisance<br>
    Of a fair agreement, in favor of an unmoving blue<br>
    Peace, unbroken by falling red<br>
    Leaves, ungoverned by arbitrary documents<br>
    <br>
    “Who needs documents?”<br>
    she’ll cry, as more and more<br>
    children are not well-read<br>
    But instead prioritize unity.<br>
    The winds of opinion that once blew<br>
    Are no longer a nuisance - <br>
    <br>
    The only remaining nuisances<br>
    Are stubbed toes and un-shredded documents<br>
    The red-white-and-blue<br>
    Has been replaced with more<br>
    of our single solid unified<br>
    Color - blue has beat out red.<br>
    <br>
    Letter and newspaper reading<br>
    is made an out-of-style nuisance<br>
    of the past - “Unity<br>
    is our one Rule.” Unwritten. Documented<br>
    in our minds and leader’s shoulders. Who could ask for anything more?<br>
    The Blue planet<br>
    <br>
    finally fulfilling its destiny of blue.<br>
    Extinct is fiery red<br>
    Greens tend more<br>
    Towards turquoise, yellow to lime, orange is a nuisance.<br>
    No spirit remains to document<br>
    The crimes of our tyrant - unity.<br>
    <br>
    No more nuisance<br>
    No more giants, no more war, no more red-white-and-blue.<br>
    No documents, no sestinas - All overwhelmed by the unlikely killer - unity.

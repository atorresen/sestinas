  <h2>Filling paper</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    I’ve filled four notebooks<br>
    At this job, and that<br>
    Only includes physical pages,<br>
    Not digital Microsoft Word<br>
    Documents. And also I’ve filled<br>
    tens - maybe hundreds - <br>
    <br>
    Of sticky notes. Hundreds<br>
    of pages of virgin notebooks<br>
    Spoiled as I fill<br>
    them with ink that<br>
    bleeds through paper, Marking each word’s<br>
    Mirror on the back of the page.<br>
    <br>
    This page<br>
    is ruined - using a number 2<br>
    pencil might save paper, but words<br>
    have more power in a book<br>
    that<br>
    is bleeding with black, filled<br>
    <br>
    with blue, overflowing<br>
    with spoiled, wrinkled, wet pages<br>
    I’d rather use a pen that<br>
    leaves a stain a hundred<br>
    pages thick than fill a notebook<br>
    With spidery grey words.<br>
    <br>
    Even if stupid words<br>
    Are what fills<br>
    My notebooks,<br>
    Even if pages<br>
    Are riddled with a hundred<br>
    Misspellings, that<br>
    <br>
    Confident ink, that<br>
    thick stroke, these solid words<br>
    Are worth a hundred<br>
    times more than unfilled<br>
    pages.<br>
    A book<br>
    <br>
    Is worth a thousand pictures, a glass half-full<br>
    of that well-inked style of word,<br>
    As with confidence and permanent gloppy dye I fill the pages of a well-used notebook.<br>
    <br>

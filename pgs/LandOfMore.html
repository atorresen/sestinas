  <h2>The Land Of More</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    My name is not important,<br>
    Nor is my face of green.<br>
    The creatures of the ocean<br>
    Know much more.<br>
    Watching the breathing, pulsing waves, I stand<br>
    Petrified by silence.<br>
    <br>
    For, beneath the surface, everything is silent.<br>
    The creatures travel with importance,<br>
    And long for dry land where they can stand.<br>
    As seaweed drifts and drops curtains of green,<br>
    They wish for more<br>
    Outside of the hushed ocean.<br>
    <br>
    The mysteries of the ocean,<br>
    The crumbling tons of silence:<br>
    Each inch means so much more<br>
    Yet miles dwindle in importance.<br>
    With water so wide the blacks look green,<br>
    Underwater it is impossible to stand.<br>
    <br>
    So up I straighten and I stand<br>
    Above the ocean.<br>
    From up above, the water looks more blue than green,<br>
    But we still long for the silence<br>
    Of leagues of great importance,<br>
    And we yearn for the feeling of much, much more.<br>
    <br>
    A fish, like we, wants more<br>
    Than she can have, and wishes to stand<br>
    In loudness (or in silence) and always in importance.<br>
    Perhaps the only place to find this is the ocean,<br>
    Where one arrives most close at silence<br>
    And at new shades of green<br>
    <br>
    and blue. Perhaps the fish is green<br>
    As well, jealous of our chanting ever more.<br>
    She longs to cease her loud, distracting silence<br>
    And to stand<br>
    Above the ocean<br>
    In importance.<br>
    <br>
    The waves of green do not stand<br>
    For peace, but jealousy, as the ocean teems with tangled, living silence;<br>
    Maybe someday I will reach the land of More, and my name, however loud, will teach importance.<br>
    <br>

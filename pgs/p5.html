  <h2>USA, 5 July</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    First day back<br>
    Since Fourth of July<br>
    Fireworks and fireflies<br>
    Red, white, and blue<br>
    Ice cream sandwich blinders<br>
    Block the peripheral celebration<br>
    <br>
    Of celebrating<br>
    A white country on a black back<br>
    Crowds of revelers blinded<br>
    by the heat of a DC July<br>
    Red, white, and blue<br>
    Deafened by the fireworks<br>
    <br>
    Some peoples’ lives are on fire<br>
    As tourists sway and celebrate<br>
    Waving red white and blue<br>
    Forgetting to look back<br>
    at 1919, 1862, 1776 4 July<br>
    A patriotic white mask blinds<br>
    <br>
    The older immigrants, blind<br>
    For generations to the firearms<br>
    In their hearts. July<br>
    Is a celebration<br>
    Only for the overdogs, committed to taking back<br>
    Their red, White, and blue<br>
    <br>
    Guise of know-how, blew<br>
    Away their own sight,<br>
    Stabbing their national peace in the back,<br>
    Setting their religion on fire,<br>
    Culminating in a hypocritical celebration<br>
    Every fourth of July.<br>
    <br>
    Still, we find optimism in the July<br>
    Swingin’ blues<br>
    A timid celebration<br>
    of a future out of sight<br>
    yet in some hearts ablaze,<br>
    To win freedom back.<br>
    <br>
    We can celebrate when the blind<br>
    man gazes into the July red white and blue<br>
    and the fireworks send his sight back.<br>
    <br>

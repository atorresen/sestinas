  <h2>Taking the train</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    Each metro car is a grab bag<br>
    Of cultures, histories, morning moods.<br>
    From the turbaned lady<br>
    Bopping her head to silent music<br>
    To the beefy, big-footed boy<br>
    Graciously accepting the advice of a plaid-clad senior,<br>
    <br>
    The metro teems with stories new and old,<br>
    Each passenger toting their day’s work in a bag<br>
    Appropriate for arrival in Mr. Boss’s<br>
    Office. Each customer projecting their carefully crafted morning mood,<br>
    Enveloped in ear bud music<br>
    So they can gaze straight through the lady<br>
    <br>
    In front of them, pretending they don’t see a lady<br>
    Who could use a seat, or an old<br>
    Man who is precariously close to falling into the lap of the these music-listening<br>
    Professionals. The courageous ones may even store their bag<br>
    On the empty seat next to them, projecting a grumpy mood,<br>
    A warning from a small woman aimed at men,<br>
    <br>
    Daring them (masculine)<br>
    To sit next to a vulnerable, easily startled lady.<br>
    The Morning Metro Mood,<br>
    Common to riders young and old,<br>
    The stuff that fills each briefcase and backpack,<br>
    The silent soundtrack,<br>
    <br>
    The clickety-clackety music<br>
    Of train tracks, and the pressing atmosphere of men’s<br>
    Deodorant are consistent, but the contents of each metro car<br>
    Change every morning and evening. I<br>
    Mix into the selections as if it’s old news,<br>
    Adopting the morning commuter mood,<br>
    <br>
    But really, my mood<br>
    Is excited - watching a symphony<br>
    Of people, all old<br>
    Enough to have complicated existences. Each man<br>
    And woman<br>
    In the grab-bag<br>
    <br>
    Metro car contributes to the old woman’s experience, the young man’s<br>
    Discovery, the private mood of earbud music,<br>
    The hours it takes to organize my bag.<br>
    <br>

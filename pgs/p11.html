  <h2>Analytic a priori</h2>

  <p>
    Once given some set of objects<br>
    Subject to a selected array of axioms,<br>
    There is nothing remaining<br>
    To deduce in the world, nor was there ever<br>
    Something to generalize from discovery,<br>
    But there were merely asteroids,<br>
    <br>
    Dinosaurs killed by asteroids,<br>
    Fish to rodents to humans crafting objects,<br>
    Inflating their heads with the self-prescribed duty of discovery<br>
    While planets planned axioms<br>
    In the trails of their orbits, forever<br>
    Weaving the ticker tape truths of the remaining<br>
    <br>
    Universe. And really, what does remain?<br>
    Between the pebbles of asteroids<br>
    Being swept by the ever-steady<br>
    Waves of the nothingness of an ocean of space, objectified<br>
    By an intelligent infant race as actors in an axiom,<br>
    Little remains to be discovered.<br>
    <br>
    With each new youthful discovery,<br>
    Our race tastes a hint of the secret truth of the remaining<br>
    Universe: that every axiom,<br>
    every star, void, and asteroid,<br>
    Is an object<br>
    Previously positioned, never<br>
    <br>
    In need of explanation, never<br>
    In need of discovery,<br>
    But simply an object<br>
    Only connected to every other remaining<br>
    Star, void, asteroid<br>
    Through the one and only axiom - <br>
    <br>
    A single governing paradoxical axiom<br>
    Traces, like an orbit, a never-ending<br>
    Circle, a path for each traveling thought or asteroid,<br>
    A hook in the stubborn lip of human discovery,<br>
    An invisible truth that our inventions remain<br>
    Mere objects.<br>
    <br>
    Dodging asteroids and Apollo 13’s for the infant’s game of discovery,<br>
    Learning axioms and writing notations for objects in general,<br>
    We are not even ready to be frightened by the threat that the objects remaining are all one object.<br>
    <br>

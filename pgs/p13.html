  <h2>Not a sestina</h2>
  <h2>(I was getting tired of the same structure)</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    A half sphere<br>
    of crepe myrtle hangs over<br>
    the fence of the house<br>
    of the across-the-street neighbors.<br>
    Its scent drips down the wood<br>
    and across the pavement.<br>
    <br>
    to the dog’s nose, lifted high in the wind<br>
    like the mast of a sailboat.<br>
    It is hot.<br>
    Even the wooden deck<br>
    burns the bare feet running over it.<br>
    The neighbors have their windows closed,<br>
    their house an air-conditioned oasis<br>
    as the neighborhood<br>
    gets drenched in the scent<br>
    of their crepe myrtle.<br>
    <br>
    The dog hops over to the neighbors’ fence,<br>
    and adds her own scent<br>
    to the sweaty floral<br>
    before racing back to her own chilly room<br>
    of air-conditioned summer comfort.<br>
    <br>

    When it is finished<br>
    This book will be a work of art<br>
    Each page full<br>
    Of sketches inspired by shapes<br>
    Of the alphabet<br>
    Each two or three pages<br>
    <br>
    Spawn of 840 pages<br>
    of a Bill I have yet to finish<br>
    reading. Instead, these permutations of the alphabet<br>
    Become the chef dâ€™oeuvre<br>
    Of my summer, shaped<br>
    By the fulfilling<br>
    <br>
    Work of lobbying for a cause full<br>
    Of 1480 pages<br>
    of legislation, shaped<br>
    by the unfinished<br>
    dream of the ultimate masterpiece<br>
    of children writing their own letters<br>
    <br>
    and Bills. I absorb alphabetically<br>
    Names of a full<br>
    Congress working on a team art<br>
    project, producing pages<br>
    &lt;ding&gt; and pages &lt;ding&gt;, speaking and voting until their work is finished,<br>
    as our education system takes shape.<br>
    <br>
    Reauthorizing, Reshaping,<br>
    Realphabetizing,<br>
    Refinishing,<br>
    Refilling,<br>
    - Filling pages,<br>
    Notebooks and binders transformed into art.<br>
    <br>
    If a blank canvas is art,<br>
    Or the arresting shapes<br>
    Of Ellsworth Kelly, then so too are these messy pages<br>
    - stacks of letters,<br>
    parallel blue lines filled<br>
    With darker lines, connected and finished<br>
    <br>
    When all 80 pages are covered in a scrambled alphabet,<br>
    When the art becomes these scribbly shapes,<br>
    When the notebook is full and the Bills are finished:<br>
    &lt;ding&gt;<br>
    &lt;schwipp&gt;<br>
    <br>

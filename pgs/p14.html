  <h2>Work shoes</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    The sneakers I’m wearing<br>
    Aren’t even cute<br>
    But they’re cushiony on my feet<br>
    And they’re tucked<br>
    Under my desk all day<br>
    Anyway, so most people<br>
    <br>
    Don’t notice there’s a person<br>
    In the office wearing<br>
    Casual shoes on a Wednesday<br>
    They just see my cute<br>
    Blouse tucked<br>
    In to a black shirt, feet<br>
    <br>
    Not visible to the boss who walks a few feet<br>
    Away from my desk, or other people<br>
    Walking past me to tuck<br>
    into their lunches, wearing<br>
    high heels and sandals - sure they look cute<br>
    But those poor feet have to spend all day<br>
    <br>
    Cooped up. All day<br>
    uncushioned. All day with feet<br>
    In uncomfortable yet cute<br>
    positions. The people<br>
    on Capitol Hill wear<br>
    only the best - designed button-ups tucked<br>
    <br>
    In to matching suits, argyle socks tucked<br>
    into the fancy shoes that, all day long,<br>
    They walk in and wear,<br>
    Mobile prisons for their feet,<br>
    Thousands of uncomfortable professional people,<br>
    Looking put-together and cute<br>
    <br>
    But those toes won’t look cute<br>
    forever, always shoved and tucked<br>
    Into fancy contraptions. When these people<br>
    Take off their shoes<br>
    They’ll see bumps and knobby feet,<br>
    Sore because of the shoes they wore.<br>
    <br>
    All the working people, Monday through Thursday,<br>
    Keep their outfits cute and their toes tucked<br>
    While my feet cozy up in the sneakers they are wearing.<br>
    <br>

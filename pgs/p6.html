  <h2>Bad poems</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    Fear: everything I write<br>
    In this borrowed book<br>
    Will be bad.<br>
    Escape: this poem<br>
    will tell a reader<br>
    that I don’t think I’m ‘all that,’<br>
    <br>
    Really, I know that<br>
    my poetry isn’t written<br>
    any betterly than the average reader<br>
    Anyone who can pick up a book<br>
    Can write this poem,<br>
    and their version probably wouldn’t be half as bad.<br>
    <br>
    What makes most poems bad<br>
    is the sense that<br>
    their poet<br>
    thought he was writing<br>
    a profound passage, fit for a book<br>
    to be passed on to generations of readers.<br>
    <br>
    Fact: most readers<br>
    probably wouldn’t think that was bad.<br>
    But critical me won’t read a poetry book<br>
    That<br>
    is decorated with superficial praise from unqualified writers.<br>
    I’ll take an amateur poem<br>
    <br>
    Any day. You have to think your poem<br>
    Is at least okay to let someone read<br>
    it, write? right? Or are other writers<br>
    braver? Or maybe they don’t care if they get a bad<br>
    reaction. They think that<br>
    Their book’s<br>
    <br>
    existence justifies the book’s<br>
    publication. Maybe my poems<br>
    will be posthumously collected - that<br>
    dream of staying virgin, unjudged, unread,<br>
    until your death forces you into modestly sharing - don’t speak badly<br>
    of the dead writers.<br>
    <br>
    That, dear reader,<br>
    is my hedging poem - an apology for this book<br>
    of bad writing.<br>
    <br>

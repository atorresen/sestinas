  <h2>Bad poems</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    Fear: everything I <span class="endWord w1">write</span><br>
    In this borrowed <span class="endWord w2">book</span><br>
    Will be <span class="endWord w3">bad</span>.<br>
    Escape: this <span class="endWord w4">poem</span><br>
    will tell a <span class="endWord w5">reader</span><br>
    that I don’t think I’m ‘all <span class="endWord w6">that</span>,’<br>
    <br>
    Really, I know <span class="endWord w6">that</span><br>
    my poetry isn’t <span class="endWord w1">written</span><br>
    any betterly than the average <span class="endWord w5">reader</span><br>
    Anyone who can pick up a <span class="endWord w2">book</span><br>
    Can write this <span class="endWord w4">poem</span>,<br>
    and their version probably wouldn’t be half as <span class="endWord w3">bad</span>.<br>
    <br>
    What makes most poems <span class="endWord w3">bad</span><br>
    is the sense <span class="endWord w6">that</span><br>
    their <span class="endWord w4">poet</span><br>
    thought he was <span class="endWord w1">writing</span><br>
    a profound passage, fit for a <span class="endWord w2">book</span><br>
    to be passed on to generations of <span class="endWord w5">readers</span>.<br>
    <br>
    Fact: most <span class="endWord w5">readers</span><br>
    probably wouldn’t think that was <span class="endWord w3">bad</span>.<br>
    But critical me won’t read a poetry <span class="endWord w2">book</span><br>
    <span class="endWord w6">That</span><br>
    is decorated with superficial praise from unqualified <span class="endWord w1">writers</span>.<br>
    I’ll take an amateur <span class="endWord w4">poem</span><br>
    <br>
    Any day. You have to think your <span class="endWord w4">poem</span><br>
    Is at least okay to let someone <span class="endWord w5">read</span><br>
    it, write? right? Or are other <span class="endWord w1">writers</span><br>
    braver? Or maybe they don’t care if they get a <span class="endWord w3">bad</span><br>
    reaction. They think <span class="endWord w6">that</span><br>
    Their <span class="endWord w2">book's</span><br>
    <br>
    existence justifies the <span class="endWord w2">book's</span><br>
    publication. Maybe my <span class="endWord w4">poems</span><br>
    will be posthumously collected - <span class="endWord w6">that</span><br>
    dream of staying virgin, unjudged, <span class="endWord w5">unread</span>,<br>
    until your death forces you into modestly sharing - don’t speak <span class="endWord w3">badly</span><br>
    of the dead <span class="endWord w1">writers</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="endWord w6">That</span>, dear <span class="endWord w5">reader</span>,<br>
    is my hedging <span class="endWord w4">poem</span> - an apology for this <span class="endWord w2">book</span><br>
    of <span class="endWord w3">bad</span> <span class="endWord w1">writing</span>.<br>
    <br>

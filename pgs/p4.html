  <h2>Using an Altoid tin to hold sticks of gum</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    Half-chewed sticks of wintergreen stained peppermint,<br>
    Muffling the revealing rumble of the curiously strong.<br>
    Is it innovation if the second use is inferior to the first?<br>
    Probably not.<br>
    Actually, probably.<br>
    The purpose of a rubber tire pales in comparison to the innovative genius of a wheel of stone.<br>
    <br>
    “I just threw together a powerpoint about earthworms.” -me, stony-faced<br>
    I hope the folks here find it helpful and refreshing.<br>
    They will, probably.<br>
    After all, my performance so far has been strong…<br>
    Actually, probably not.<br>
    Unless they get really drunk first.<br>
    <br>
    Who’s on first?<br>
    “The apostrophic punctuation works well here to display the ambiguity.” -the stone face<br>
    I bumped a foul ball into fair territory - yer out! (not safe).<br>
    A double play too, because Who was on his game, blowing minty<br>
    sugar-free bubbles (He’s so strong<br>
    willed, he buys his own instead of Hubba Bubba Max. Who has healthier teeth, probably.)<br>
    <br>
    Also, he probably<br>
    is Asian, according to the initial<br>
    assumptions that his reasoning powers are strong,<br>
    his will is immovable as stone,<br>
    his name is one vowel-y syllable and he likes mint.<br>
    Then again, maybe (probably) not.<br>
    <br>
    I’m doing work. I’m not<br>
    waiting for the clock to strike 5 or, probably,<br>
    more like 5:10 to be polite. My mint<br>
    green “available” phone status will fade to<br>
    traffic sign “away” yellow.<br>
    First, mint, stone, strong - shit<br>
    Sestina game not strong.<br>
    <br>
    “It takes strength<br>
    Not<br>
    to rip out each messy page and “grind it on the limestone<br>
    of pain and necessity” -HG Wells, probably<br>
    I have to fill the notebook first<br>
    Before I crumple, chew, and spit it out like peppermint.<br>
    <br>
    Stone face, probably,<br>
    is strong, though not<br>
    the first idiot to try to end seven sentences with “peppermint.”<br>

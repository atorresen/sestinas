  <h2>Using an Altoid tin to hold sticks of gum</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    Half-chewed sticks of wintergreen stained <span class="endWord w1">peppermint</span>,<br>
    Muffling the revealing rumble of the curiously <span class="endWord w2">strong</span>.<br>
    Is it innovation if the second use is inferior to the <span class="endWord w3">first</span>?<br>
    Probably <span class="endWord w4">not</span>.<br>
    Actually, <span class="endWord w5">probably</span>.<br>
    The purpose of a rubber tire pales in comparison to the innovative genius of a wheel of <span class="endWord w6">stone</span>.<br>
    <br>
    “I just threw together a powerpoint about earthworms.” -me, <span class="endWord w6">stony-faced</span><br>
    I hope the folks here find it helpful and <span class="endWord w1">minty fresh</span>.<br>
    They will, <span class="endWord w5">probably</span>.<br>
    After all, my performance so far has been <span class="endWord w2">strong</span>…<br>
    Actually, probably <span class="endWord w4">not</span>.<br>
    Unless they get really drunk <span class="endWord w3">first</span>.<br>
    <br>
    Who’s on <span class="endWord w3">first</span>?<br>
    “The punctuation removes the ambiguity.” <span class="endWord w6">-the stone face</span><br>
    I bumped a foul ball into fair territory - yer out! <span class="endWord w4">(not safe)</span>.<br>
    A double play too, because Who was off his game, blowing <span class="endWord w1">minty</span><br>
    sugar-free bubbles (He’s so <span class="endWord w2">strong-</span><br>
    willed, he buys his own instead of Hubba Bubba Max. Who has healthy teeth, <span class="endWord w5">probably</span>.)<br>
    <br>
    Also, he <span class="endWord w5">probably</span><br>
    is Asian, according my <span class="endWord w3">first</span><br>
    assumption that his reasoning powers are <span class="endWord w2">strong</span>,<br>
    plus his will is immovable as <span class="endWord w6">stone</span>,<br>
    his name is one vowel-y syllable and he likes <span class="endWord w1">mint</span>.<br>
    Then again, probably <span class="endWord w4">not</span>.<br>
    <br>
    I’m doing work. I’m <span class="endWord w4">not</span><br>
    waiting for the clock to strike 5 or, <span class="endWord w5">probably</span>,<br>
    more like 5:10 to be polite. My <span class="endWord w1">mint</span><br>
    green “available” phone status will fade to<br>
    traffic sign “away” yellow.<br>
    First, mint, stone, strong - shit<br>
    Sestina game not <span class="endWord w2">strong</span>.<br>
    <br>
    “It takes <span class="endWord w2">strength</span><br>
    <span class="endWord w4">Not</span><br>
    to rip out each messy page and “grind it on the <span class="endWord w6">stone</span><br>
    of pain and necessity” -H.G. Wells, <span class="endWord w5">probably</span><br>
    I have to fill the notebook <span class="endWord w3">first</span><br>
    Before I crumple, chew, and spit it out like <span class="endWord w1">Doublemint</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="endWord w6">Stone</span> face, <span class="endWord w5">probably</span>,<br>
    is <span class="endWord w2">strong</span>, though <span class="endWord w4">not</span><br>
    the <span class="endWord w3">first</span> idiot to try to end seven sentences with “<span class="endWord w1">peppermint</span>.”<br>

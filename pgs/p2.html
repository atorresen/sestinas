  <h2>Monotheism</h2>
  <button class="homebutton"><a href="../poems.html">back</a></button>

  <p>
    You are a North wind to ripe figs<br>
    Clambering through trees and blossoms.<br>
    Zarathustra, posthumously misunderstood shepherd,<br>
    Sing above the herd<br>
    And mock the man who thinks<br>
    His leap is its (our) salvation.<br>
    <br>
    Fertile crescent of salvation,<br>
    From where came farms and figures,<br>
    versions of new civilized thought<br>
    and newly stationary blossoms,<br>
    Left its inheritance to a herd<br>
    of grateful sheep without a shepherd.<br>
    <br>
    Now to those forebearers we are sheep,<br>
    At loss in a sea of false salvations<br>
    and promises targeted to the herd<br>
    of mass mentality, propaganda, fig newtons.<br>
    Ante christum natum, selfish thought blossoms.<br>
    A selfish thought is a practical thought.<br>
    <br>
    Altered hearts and rules of thinking,<br>
    under guise of that great shepherd,<br>
    Bears new names of tender blossoms,<br>
    Locks their sweetness in a safe,<br>
    Plants the myth of BCE, when caryatids fed figs<br>
    to wealthy worshippers, a herd governed by another herd.<br>
    <br>
    The blueberry dusk lays low on the sleepy herd<br>
    as the sun’s thoughts go quiet,<br>
    stars grow in the sky like sweet figs,<br>
    and the moon stands in as shepherd.<br>
    Blind to a need for salvation,<br>
    the sheep sleep until the dawn again blossoms.<br>
    <br>
    Blossom for us (me), Zarathustra, blossom!<br>
    “Another leader!”, plead the invisible we,<br>
    “Save us from the distracting promise of a singular salvation.”<br>
    Not even are these thoughts,<br>
    but weeds. Add a gardener to our shepherd’s<br>
    post, and harvest human figs.<br>
    <br>
    Please, absent leader, save me (us) from the unfulfilled desire of our secret thoughts.<br>
    When cherries blossom and buds fall to the earth at the stampede of the herd,<br>
    our shepherd may give way to another wind to ripe figs.<br>
    <br>
